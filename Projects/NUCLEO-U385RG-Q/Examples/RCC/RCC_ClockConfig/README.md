## <b>RCC_ClockConfig Example Description</b>

Configuration of the system clock (SYSCLK) and modification of the clock settings in Run mode, using the RCC HAL API.

   - Board: NUCLEO-U385RG-Q (embeds a STM32U385RGTxQ device)
   - Microcontroller Clock Output MCO1 Pin: PA.08 (Arduino connector CN9 pin 8 D7, Morpho connector CN10 pin 23)

In this example, after startup SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the
MSIS as clock source, the User push-button (connected to B1) will be
used to change the source:

- from MSIS to HSE
- from HSE to HSI
- from HSI to MSIS

Each time the User push-button is pressed External line 13 interrupt is generated and in the ISR
the SYSCLK oscillator source is checked using __HAL_RCC_GET_SYSCLK_SOURCE() macro:

- If the HSE oscillator is selected as SYSCLK source, the following steps will be followed to switch
   the SYSCLK source to HSI oscillator:
     a. Switch the system clock source to HSE to allow modification of the SYSCLK configuration
     b. Enable HSI Oscillator, select it as SYSCLK source and finally activate the SYSCLK
     c. Select the SYSCLK as system clock source and configure bus clocks dividers
     d. Disable the HSE oscillator (optional, if the HSE is no more needed by the application)

- If the HSI oscillator is selected as SYSCLK source, the following steps will be followed to switch
   the SYSCLK source to MSIS oscillator:
     a. Switch the system clock source to HSI to allow modification of the SYSCLK configuration
     b. Enable MSIS Oscillator, select it as SYSCLK source and finally activate the SYSCLK
     c. Select the SYSCLK as system clock source and configure bus clocks dividers
     d. Disable the HSI oscillator (optional, if the HSI is no more needed by the application)

- If the MSIS oscillator is selected as SYSCLK source, the following steps will be followed to switch
   the SYSCLK source to HSE oscillator:
     a. Switch the system clock source to MSIS to allow modification of the SYSCLK configuration
     b. Enable HSE Oscillator, select it as SYSCLK source and finally activate the SYSCLK
     c. Select the SYSCLK as system clock source and configure bus clocks dividers
     d. Disable the MSIS oscillator (optional, if the MSIS is no more needed by the application)

LD2 is toggled with a timing defined by the HAL_Delay() API.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
